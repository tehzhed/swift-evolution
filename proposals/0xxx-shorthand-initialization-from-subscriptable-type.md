# Shorthand syntax for variable initalization from subscriptable type

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-name.md)
* Author(s): [Daniele Riccardelli](https://github.com/tehzhed)
* Status: **[Awaiting review](#rationale)**
* Review manager: TBD

## Introduction

Using Python's terminology, as of today Swift allows us to unpack tuples:
```swift
let (name, surname, nickname) = ("Daniele", "Riccardelli", "tehzhed")
```

But this syntax is counterintuitive: the left-hand side in fact doesn't initialize a tuple, but 3 distinct variables.
The idea is to simplify the syntax in the following way:
```swift
let name, surname, nickname = ("Daniele", "Riccardelli", "tehzhed")
```
In a fashion similar to the one found in Python (where this idea originates from).
Swift is a language designed for simplicity and intuitiveness of syntax, and therefore, it is natural to consider every subscriptable type to allow unpacking values.

Therefore, this would be allowed:
```swift
let name, surname, nickname = ["Daniele", "Riccardelli", "tehzhed"]
```
Similarly would happen with non constants ```var```s.

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the
problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show
how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its
drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be
emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help Swift
developers create better Swift code.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new
syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Swift
grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably implement the feature.

## Impact on existing code

This proposals suggests a new shorthand syntax that doesn't break compatibility with existing code.

## Alternatives considered

One alternative could be to use the syntax currently used to unpack tuples into variables for all subscriptable types:

```swift
let (name, surname, nickname) = ["Daniele", "Riccardelli", "tehzhed"]
```

While this would still allow more concise and readable code, would still be less intuitive and slightly more verbose than the approach suggested above.
